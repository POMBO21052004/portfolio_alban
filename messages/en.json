By separating business rules from technical details (frameworks, databases), it allows for technology changes without rewriting the application's core.\n\nIt facilitates unit testing and ensures the code remains readable and understandable even after years of maintenance. Investing time in architecture at the beginning saves months of technical debt later. In this article, we'll see how to structure your projects to stand the test of time."

However, it will never replace the developer for one simple reason: development is not just writing lines of code, it's primarily about solving complex business problems.\n\nAI lacks empathy, global product vision, and especially the ability to understand the deep human intent behind a feature. It is a powerful tool for the craftsman, but it's the craftsman who owns and carries the vision. Discover why the future of development is an augmented man-machine collaboration."
